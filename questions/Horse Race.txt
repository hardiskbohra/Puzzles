Question : What is the minimum number of races necessary to determine your three fastest horses? (25 horses, 5 horse in each race, find top 3 horses)

Answer : 7 Races

Explanation :

  Let's say, We have 25 Horses and the group of 5 horses are :

  G1 = H1, H2, H3, H4, H5
  G2 = H6, H7, H8, H9, H10
  G3 = H11, H12, H13, H14, H15
  G4 = H16, H17, H18, H19, H20
  G5 = H21, H22, H23, H24, H25

  H1 comes first in the race then H2 then H3 then H4 and then H5

  Race 1 : H1, H2, H3, H4, H5

  Race 2 : H6, H7, H8, H9, H10

  Race 3 : H11, H12, H13, H14, H15

  Race 4 : H16, H17, H18, H19, H20

  Race 5 : H21, H22, H23, H24, H25

  Now arrange race between winner's of all the above races as :

  Race 6 : H1, H6, H11, H16, H21

  As H6 comes second in the race, so we can be sure that only H7 could have the possibility of third fastest horse
  and horses (H8, H9, H10) cannot acquire top 3 positions rather they can be at any position between fourth one to last position.

  As H1 comes first in the race, so we can be sure that only H2 and H3 could have the possibility of second and third fastest horse respectively
  and horses (H4, H5)cannot acquire top 3 positions rather they can be at any position between fourth one to last position.

  Race 7 : H2, H3, H6, H7, H11
