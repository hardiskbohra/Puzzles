Question : Make a calendar days using two six sided dices.

Answer : We are using two six sided dices..

         Dice 1 = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
         Dice 2 = 6, 7, 8, 0, 1, 2

         here, we can use 6 for the number 9.
         we need 11, 22. That's why we are taking digit 1 and digit 2 two times.
